This repo will consist of Java-based implementations of simple (aka likely not to work in several cases) parsers for JSON and XML. 

I will be following the approach laid out in [this](https://notes.eatonphil.com/writing-a-simple-json-parser.html) blog post. 

These parsers are intended to be used to help complete [this](https://hyperskill.org/projects/61?track=1) project from the Jetbrains Academy/Hyperskill Java track.
